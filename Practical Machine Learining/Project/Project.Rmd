# Practical Machne Learning Project
Final course project.

## Read Data
```
setwd('/Practical Machine Learining/Project');
training = read.csv(file = 'pml-training.csv', sep = ',', header = T);
testing  = read.csv(file = 'pml-testing.csv', sep = ',', header = T);
```
Or, reading directly from the URLs:

```
trainingURL = 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv';
testingURL  = 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv';

training = read.csv(url(trainingURL), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""));
testing  = read.csv(url(trainingURL), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""));
```

##Set seed:
```
set.seed(184);
```

##Load library:
```
library(caret);
```

##Model fitting
I used random forrets to predict variable 'classe' based on other variables. I did a 5-fold corss-validation:
```
trainCtrl = trainControl(method = 'cv', number = 5);

model = train(classe ~ ., 
              data = trainData, 
              method = 'rf',
              trControl = trainCtrl);

print(model)
print(model$finalModel)
randomForest(x = x, y = y, mtry = param$mtry) 
               Type of random forest: classification
                     Number of trees: 500
No. of variables tried at each split: 6952

        OOB estimate of  error rate: 1.25%
Confusion matrix:
   A  B  C  D  E class.error
A 91  0  0  0  0  0.00000000
B  0 62  1  0  0  0.01587302
C  0  1 56  0  0  0.01754386
D  0  0  0 55  1  0.01785714
E  0  0  0  1 53  0.01851852

```
As it can be seen, the OOB (Out of Bag/Out of Sample) estimate of error rate is 1.25%, which is very good.

##Testing the model using the test set
```
tests = predict(model, newdata = testing);

pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(tests);
```
